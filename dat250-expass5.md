## Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how you resolved
First of all the installation of MongoDB was somewhat hard to understand. I had a hard time understanding how we were supposed to install it and why we had to validate the installation package. However, I managed to overcome these issues, as seen below. 

## Screenshots for:

#### The correct validation of the installation package (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/)

#### Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant from each CRUD operation).

#### Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you.

## Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.
